The project was developed with an aim to highlight my knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL

Main Functionalities:
1. Ability to add a task for any date as per users choice.
2. Ability to mark the task as done 
3. Ability to delete the task.
4. A task added and not marked as done or deleted will be visible for all dates after the date of task creation. 

The page which displays the tasks for a particular date is created dynamically with the help of JavaScript as per the data from the database.
JavaScript has also been used for marking the task as done or deleting or adding tasks.

The code files for the project are available on GitHub. For more information contact me at avanipatwa@gmail.com.
