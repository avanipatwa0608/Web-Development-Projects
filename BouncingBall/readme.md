This is a mini project developed with an aim to hightlight my knowledge in HTML, CSS and JQuery.

HTML and CSS: Used to develop the design.

JQuery: Used for the animation effects of the balls.

The bouncing ball is a game wherein 6 balls are bouncing inside a box. The aim of the game is to catch the black ball with the help of the mouse pointer.
Once the black ball is caught, all the balls come back to their original position and game ends.

The code files for the project are available on GitHub. For more information contact me at avanipatwa@gmail.com.
