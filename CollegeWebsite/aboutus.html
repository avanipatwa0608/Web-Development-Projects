                Imperial University for Higher Education was founded by Late Mrs. Sharda Shah on 21st March 1980.
                The university was founded with an aim to provide an equal chance for higher education to one and all. <br>
                In the words of Swami Vivekananda, “We want that education by which character is formed, strength of mind is increased, the intellect expanded, and by which one can stand on one’s own feet.”
                <br>
                We have now grown into a multi-disciplinary and multi-campus education institution with over 1500 faculty, and 38,000 students.

            <h1>Our Vision</h1>
   <p class="aboutustxt mt-2">Our education in any subject will reflect its timeless fundamentals, its current context, and applications. There is so much scientific discovery taking place, at the intersection of fields, of biology, computing, medicine, the social sciences and everywhere else. We will provide students and faculty with an environment to engage this world, to discover new truths, make new applications to create and share knowledge. </p>
  <p class="aboutustxt mt-2"> Our education will also be experiential. With projects that are ‘real’ and those that complement the learning inside the classroom. Our students and faculty will be at the cutting edge of change, to incubate companies, to create NGOs, and pursue any field of their passion.</p>
  <p class="aboutustxt mt-2"> Our education will also be holistic. Sports and physical exercise must be a firm part of the curriculum. For students to develop a love for sports, for recreation, for health, for teamwork, for competition. Our education will also instill an appreciation for art and culture.</p>

        <p class="aboutustxt mt-2">International collaborations with universities across the globe have enhanced our education and research programmes. </p>
<p class="aboutustxt mt-2">Through collaborations with international universities we aspire to explore mutually beneficial opportunities for academic connections like Faculty and Student Exchange Programs; Joint Research and Publications, Study abroad in India Programs; Immersive Programs, International Internships and Placements.</p>
<p class="aboutustxt mt-2">Imperial University for Higher Education has academic collaboration with leading universities in USA, Europe, Asia and Africa for working together to promote Academics, Research, and Experiential Learning beyond the scope of an individual university.</p>
